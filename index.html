  <h1> My Stage 0 Notes</h1>
<p> In Unit 1 we learned that the main type of document on the web is <em>HTML</em>. We also learned that web files can be <em>plain text, HTML, images, videos, and music.</em>
</p>
<p><b>HTML-</b>stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. It utilizes -text content, -markup, references to other documents, and -links to other pages</p>
<p><b>Basic HTML Vocabulary-</b>consists of</p>
<p>o A Tag- An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and closing tag.
Some tags (called <em><b>"void"</b></em>tags) do not require a closing tag</p>
<p>o An Element- An HTML element consists of the content contain within the opening and closing tag.</p>
<p>o An Attribute- is a property of an <em> HTML</em> element.</p>
<p>I have learned the <em> so far</em> there are two types of elements:</p>
<p><b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b></p>
<p>Examples of Inline are: "b", "em", and "img". An example of a block element is "p". A block element encapsulates the content into an <em>"invisible box"</em>. "Span" and "Div" are also examples of inline and block elements.I have much more to learn as I cannot yet use the < or > in my text without the code trying to create a new element.</p>
<p> An example of a tag that uses an HTML Attribute woulds be the "a" or anchor tag. It would contain an attribute, followed by a "value", the content, and a closing tag.</p>
<p> A useful job aid that the instructor provided to practice code is called "<em>HTML_Playground</em>" and can be found<a href="www. udacity.com/html_playground"> HERE.</a> I tried to practice a bit with it but much prefer using an alternate site called <a href="scratchpad.io">scratchpad</a>.</p>
